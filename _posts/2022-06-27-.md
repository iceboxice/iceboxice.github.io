Welcome to the wonderful world of widgets.  
==========================================

Today's widget is an answer that traverses kernal density estimates (KDE), bandwidth sliders, and geysers.  

Q: What is this geyser's eruption interval? Eruptions are triggered when the geyser's superheated water builds up enough pressure underground. Silica drops out of the cooling water as the water rises to the surface; forming an undergorund protective coating.   

STEPS  
1. import ipywidgets, seaborn, pyplot, ipython display  
2. load Seaborn "geyser" dataset  
3. KDE plot  
4. KDE w/ integer slider (or float slider) plot  
5. adjust bandwidth slider to determine answer
